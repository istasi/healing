**Healing Guide** by **Tutreak**

I've long been wanting to try and write a guide on how i think about healing, this is not a guide to determine which rank of what skill is the best to use.
its gonna be annoying to read, its gonna be way too long, and if i write this right, you'll have more questions when you're done reading it.

So, as i see it, there's 3 different "*styles*" of healing everyone does: **reaction**, **anticipation**, and **prediction**.

**Reaction** is, you see a dude taking damage, you react to that and heal him
**Anticipation** is, you know a tank is about to take damage, so you heal pre-emptively so your heal lands when the tank takes damage
**Prediction** is, you know when warlocks are gonna lifetap, you know when a rogue attacks something he shouldn't, so you heal pre-emptively os your heal lands as they take damage.

You can definitely argue that **anticipation** is the same type of healing as **prediction**, just taken to a higher level, and you're right, im still gonna keep it as its own style due to difficulty of doing it, as you can also argue that **anticipation** is just **reaction** healing. 



So going over each of the styles in more details, will try and add as much information about each as i can think of:
**Reaction**:
Its whack a mole, and you're reacting to whatever information you have, lots of people take damage at the same time, what you react to 
what information sources (such as healcomm and certain weakauras) is telling you and you heal something based on that.

There's two aspects to this, first and easist to identify is human reaction time as meassured by this https://humanbenchmark.com/tests/reactiontime/, but someone can score higher ms than you and still land their heals before you do simply based on reaction healing
another aspect to reaction healing is decision making, so when a person takes damage, you need to decide what skill do i use, questions related to this is:
* Does he need it instantly, fast or can i be slow?
* Do my XX cd ready for instant healing?
* Do i have mana for it to be instantly, or fast?, do i have mana for the slow high rank?
* Will other healers try and snipe my heal if i do it slow?
* Should i let him die because if i heal him a higher valued player (such as a tank) might die instead?
* Should i wait abit so i can use a group or aoe heal instead, incase other people take damage aswell?
* Is he going to die before i can land a heal?

So you can have faster reaction times than XX person, but still be slower at landing your heals depending on the decision tree you do when you are healing
We all have this decision tree, although yours might look different than mine, and some of you might even argue that you dont do this, you 'just' heal but that likely means your decision tree is subconscious instead, it still takes time for you to process this.


**Anticipation**:
In its essence, this is tank healing, you have a swing timer, you have a tank, you have a boss, you match your healing cast time to the swing timer, 
tank takes damage, tank gets healed, the sooner after the damage taken your heal lands, the better. 

So this builds on top of **reaction** healing except you're limiting yourself to a few targets (most often the tanks). Its very easy to start getting tunnel vision here and die to stupid shit such as rain of fire or the likes, because your whole world is if i heal every 1.5s, the 2nd heal last just abit too early, so i need to cast a 1.5s cast then wait 200ms then cast again, then it lands just right after he takes damage, wait it didn't work this time?, parry haste?, and you just constantly try and adjust to the random ass parry hastes that messes up what should be simply clicking every 1.7s, so you add these to your decision tree.

* If i use a slow heal here now, will parry haste fix it or make it worse?
* If i use a fast heal here now, will parry haste fix it or make it worse?

You might not have considered this, or you're past it where you've realised its too much effort to try and track considering what you gain from it, for some people its easy, for others not so.

**Prediction**:
The same as **anticipation** but you look at the whole raid instead of just the tank.

Depending on your class and role you're performing, you might start on this type of healing before **anticipation**.
One way to start doing this type is, though addons, some addons makes this easier than others, take vuhdo (a unit frame addon) which puts a red border on anyone that has aggro on anything, so if a melee dps overaggros, he gets a red border, and he'll likely get hit in the face shortly after, if a mage get a red border, same thing here.


**How to get better.**
*This is going to blend together with the styles mentioned above, as its all based on reaction.*

**Reaction**
Alright so to improve your reaction time, properly management of mental health and physical body, this includes sleeping properly, and getting enough of it, medication to get rid of reactive stress, generally making sure your body has what it needs to function as well as it can, if your body is stressed because it needs something, it'll effect your mental state as well, and this will effect your healing. After that then its just down to practicing on things that requires reaction times, it could be though gaming, fps shooters and the likes, or it could be though irl sports.

As for how to optimise your decision tree, its realising exactly what decisions you should be making, what goals effect your decisions, once you know this exactly, it gets easier to make the decisions, lets do an example. So i play a paladin, as such, the tree im using looks more like this, imagen this, a tank takes 8k dmg in 1 second out of the blue and we are 30 seconds into a boss pull, fight lasts 2 minutes.

* Is he going to die before a 1.5s?, he might very well
* Can i bop him?, is the boss tauntable?, is another tank 2nd on threat?, worth the risk of messing threat up?
* Can i use Holy shock on him?, would it make a difference?
* Try flash of light(1.5s cast) or holy light(2.5s cast) and hope a druid can instant heal him?, that allows me to land my heal?
* Should i Lay on Hands him, making me go oom?, but he'll be saved?

If i had to think about all these things every single heal, my reaction times would probably be close to 400ms, so what instead happens is that we think of these questions beforehand, if a tank take sudden huge damage spike, am i willing to loh?, yes i am. So you KNOW the answer to this question beforehand, and if you're willing to do that, the very first question on your desicion tree is:
* Is he the tank?
* Have he taken enough dmg for lay on hands?

And yes, he has, so you lay on hands, this makes your healing alot easier and faster to do because you know exactly what to do beforehand, you dont have to sit and decide.

You do this for all the roles take melee dps:
* Are you willing to lay on hands?
* Are you willing to slow heal them?
* What should happen for you to be willing to slow heal them?

It will greatly increase your reaction time the less questions you need to consider when healing a person. Once you have your questions down, use repetition on it so you move it into your subconcious making it faster still.

**Prediction**:
When you know the fight well, you know when there's breaks, when you know where the breaks in the fight are, you know where warlocks are gonna lifetap, 

You know shits about to go down unless the tank is able and ready to taunt fast, otherwise threat is about to become a huge mess, as even if the mage is removed from the aggro table, it still moves to the mage, putting all other ranged dps into melee distance of said mob, so now the tank not only have to catch up to the +30% threat the og mage had, but he has to surpass the 2nd, 3rd and 4th highest aswell or how ever many passed the tank but kept under then 30% threshold, by 10% threat to get it back to him, which is gonna cause alot of "random" damage going around, except its all shown the threat meter, 1st mage gets a bop, mob goes to 2nd
